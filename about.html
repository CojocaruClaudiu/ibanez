              Ibanez (アイバニーズ, Aibanīzu) is a renowned Japanese guitar
              brand owned by Hoshino Gakki. Based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan,
              Hoshino Gakki became pioneers in the Japanese music industry. They
              gained significant recognition in import guitar sales across the
              United States and Europe. Ibanez holds the distinction of being
              the first brand to mass-produce seven-string and eight-string
              guitars.

              <br />
              Ibanez's global footprint spans Japan, China, Indonesia, and the
              United States, with a custom shop in Los Angeles. As of 2017,
              their extensive lineup included nearly 165 models of bass guitars,
              130 acoustic guitars, and over 300 electric guitars. Today, Ibanez
              stands proudly as the third-largest guitar brand, following in the
              footsteps of industry giants Gibson and Fender.

              The story begins in 1908 when Hoshino Gakki started as the musical
              instrument sales division of the Hoshino Shoten, a Japanese
              bookstore chain. The journey involved importing Spanish-style
              acoustic guitars, initially branded "Ibanez Salvador" to honor
              Spanish luthier Salvador Ibáñez. Over time, the brand evolved,
              changing its spelling to "Ibanez" in 1986, reflecting an English
              pronunciation.

              Hoshino Gakki faced a legal challenge from Gibson Guitars in 1977,
              accusing them of using the Gibson headstock design and logo. The
              case was settled out of court in early 1978. Post-lawsuit, Ibanez
              shifted its strategy, moving away from copying classic electric
              guitar designs. They introduced a range of original designs,
              including the Artist models, Performer, Concert, Musicians,
              Iceman, Roadster, and Roadstar, competing with and surpassing
              famous American brands.

              <br />
              Embracing modern elements, Ibanez incorporated radical body
              shapes, slimmer necks, 2-octave fingerboards, pointed headstocks,
              high-output electronics, and various pickup configurations. This
              marked the beginning of a new era, influencing the popular
              superstrat trend in the mid-1980s.
